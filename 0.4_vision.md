# Rendering

In 0.3 macroquad all draw calls are always, automatically batched.

draw_whatever(); will always do a `quad_gl` call, basically appending some vertices to some already existing gpu buffer to be rendered later. This takes into account materials, textures etc, making new buffers when needed.

So this is basically a dynamic batching for all the meshes all the time.
Which is fine when most of the meshes are 2D sprites with the same textures, but
it do not work for 3d or more complicated 2d scenes at all.

So the main goal for 0.4 macroquad: allow dynamic, static and no batching for draw calls.

So far the idea is:

- destroy all draw_* functions and use a builder pattern.

Like this:
```rust
// this will create a nice CPU-only sprite
let sprite = Square::new()
  .pos(vec2(x, y))
  .texture(texture);

// this will upload a model to GPU and will make it drawable by itself 
let model = sprite.stateful_gpu_object();

// will draw right away, without any batching
scene_graph().draw(&model);

// acquire an old good `guad_gl` instance, basically
let sprite_layer = scene_graph().sprite_layer();

// do what draw_texture() did in 0.3
sprite_layer.append(sprite);
sprite_layer.append(sprite.pos(vec2(x + 10, y)));
sprite_layer.append(some_text);

// do what macroquad did internally when batching got breaked by a new material
// or on the end of the frame
scene_graph().draw(sprite_layer);
```

# Compatibility with 0.3

To keep compatibility, something like `macroquad::im_legacy_old_api` may be introduced.
It will just wrap new builder calls into old draw_* calls on one single sprite_layer.

# Design thoughts

macroquad's main loop, scenes and coroutines were nice, but, maybe, its time to let them go.

No one really use scenes/coroutines but me in the fishgame anyway :D

So it may be a good idea to keep macroquad pure, just rendering, assets, sounds etc,
but do not touch game's architecture.

Instead of `scene` as a thing for game nodes, macroquad will have its own "scene_graph" (scene_graph() thing from previous section). And games will take some sort of handles from macroquad into their own "ecs","nodes" or whatever.

# "Plugin" crates

0.4 should somehow address a "cargo feature" problem.

When user have this
```
macroquad = "0.3"
macroquad_tiled = "0.1"
```
in their cargo.toml - everything is good, macroquad_tiled internally use macroquad, and it is all the same macroquad.
But with
```
macroquad = {version = "0.3", default-features = false, features = ["3d", "audio"]}
macroquad_tiled = "0.3"
```

macroquad_tiled still depends on `macroquad` with default features, while the game itself on different macroquad. Right now cargo just silently enable features back, therefore makes them completely unusable :/

Still do not have any solution. Maybe remove all the features and make macroquad's features illegal? Not really sure.
